Hi! Here is my solution, to run it, just follow the instructions below!
1. Download all the files to a folder, I recommend putting it on your desktop!
2. Open the command prompt on your computer, for windows type 'cmd' into the search bar
3. type cd desktop/desknibbles      (you can replace desktop with where you put the folder, and desknibbles with the folders name)
4. type "python3 DeskNibbles.py"
That's it!

Any questions? Email me at andrew.pletsch@carleton.ca
